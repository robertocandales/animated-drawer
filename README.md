- Drawer Navigation: Implement a smooth and customizable drawer navigation using React Native Reanimated. Users should be able to swipe from the edge of the screen to open the drawer, and swipe it back to close it.

- Nested Navigation: Showcase nested navigation within the drawer menu. This could include different sections or categories that expand into subcategories or individual screens.

- Header Integration: Integrate a header component that adapts to the current screen or section within the drawer navigation. This header should provide navigation controls like a back button or a menu icon to open/close the drawer.

- Animated Transitions: Utilize animations provided by React Native Reanimated to create smooth transitions between screens and when opening/closing the drawer.
