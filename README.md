- Nested Navigation: Showcase nested navigation within the drawer menu. This could include different sections or categories that expand into subcategories or individual screens.

- Header Integration: Integrate a header component that adapts to the current screen or section within the drawer navigation. This header should provide navigation controls like a back button or a menu icon to open/close the drawer.
